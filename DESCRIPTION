Description: 
    This package implements fuzzy DBSCAN both, with fuzzy core and fuzzy border.
    Therefore it provides a method to initialize and run the algorithm and a
    function to predict new data w.t.h. of `R6`.
    The package is build upon the paper "Fuzzy Extensions of the DBScan algorithm"
    from Dino Ienco and Gloria Bordogna.
    The predict function assignes new data based on the same criteria as the algorithm itself.
    However, the prediction function freezes the algorithm to perserve the trained
    cluster structure and treats each new prediction object individually.
