Description: 
    This package implements Fuzzy DBSCAN with both Fuzzy Core and Fuzzy Border.
    Therefore it provides a method to initialize and run the algorithm and a
    function to predict new data w.t.h. of `R6`.
    The package is build upon the paper "Fuzzy Extensions of the DBScan algorithm"
    from Dino Ienco and Gloria Bordogna.
    A predict function assigns new data according to the same criteria as the algorithm itself.
    However, the prediction function freezes the algorithm to preserve the trained
    cluster structure and treats each new prediction object individually.
